Unchecking this will cause the impassible tiles to generate in a more consistent, and almost entirely filled in manner. Note that open sections of the map will be undiscovered when you first arrive at the map, so you'll have to expolore to find them. Also, it's possible that you can get maps with no way to enter them or exit them due to mountains. The game is still very playble, it will make caravans impossible until you mine to the edge of the map, and it'll cause raids to fail.</RH_TET_Dwarfs_UseVanillaMapGenDesc>

I'm one guy who spends a whole lot of time on these mods. If you enjoyed it, then please show your love!
