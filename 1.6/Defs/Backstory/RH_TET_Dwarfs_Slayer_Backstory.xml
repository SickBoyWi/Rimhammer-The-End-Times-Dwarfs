		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a master gatherer. [PAWN_pronoun] could find food in the most barren of places using [PAWN_possessive] expansive knowledge of plants, fungi, roots, and berries. Whether on the mountainsides, or under the mountain, [PAWN_pronoun] excelled at finding the best edible morsels. [PAWN_pronoun] once mistook poisonous mushrooms for edible ones, causing the sickness of several relatives. [PAWN_pronoun] could find no way to forgive what [PAWN_pronoun]'d done, so [PAWN_pronoun] joined the slayer cult to atone.</description>
