		<letterText>A lost dwarf named {PAWN_nameDef} has tunnelled up from an unknown mine, and is joining the colony. [PAWN_pronoun] has been lost underground for some time after having been with a group of miners when a mine shaft collapsed, trapping them all. {PAWN_nameDef} was forced to tunnel out to the surface. [PAWN_pronoun] is pleased to have surfaced among fellow dwarfs. \n\n[PAWN_pronoun] is willing to contribute, but will not leave voluntarily. If you don't want {PAWN_nameDef}, you can banish {PAWN_objective}, sell {PAWN_objective} into slavery, or simply kill {PAWN_objective}. However, your other colonists may find this disturbing.</letterText>
